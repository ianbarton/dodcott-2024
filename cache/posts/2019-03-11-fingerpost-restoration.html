<p>Work has almost been completed on restoring the finger post signs at Goldsmiths and Wilkesley. The Parish Council is hoping to be able to restore the sign on the island outside Fields View. In addition we hope to be able to convert the grass triangle into some sort of hard standing, which will make it safer for children waiting for the school bus.</p>
