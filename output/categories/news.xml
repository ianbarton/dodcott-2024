St Mary's and St Michael's in Burleydam. This commemorates the members
of the parish who were killed in the conflict. The memorial was
erected in 1920 and is made from sandstone. In recent years the
engravings of the names of the fallen have started to become
indistinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been lucky to obtain donations from Burleydam Village Hall
Trust, Combermere Abbey and a Communities Grant from Cheshire
East to re-cut the names.  The work will be completed in the next few
months, so the names should be preserved for many more years.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>news</category><guid>http://dodcott.org/posts/2014-09-04-war-memorial-renovation./</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2014 13:49:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Parish Council Extraordinary Meeting July Monday August 11th 2014.</title><link>http://dodcott.org/posts/2014-08-11-parish-council-egm/</link><dc:creator>Dodcott-cum-Wilkesley Parish Council</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;There will be an Extraordinary General Meeting at the Burleydam

began the Great War. A short ceremony was held at the War Memorial at
St Mary's and St Michael's Church at Burleydam. It was a warm sunny
morning and about 30 people attended. During the ceremony the names of
the soldiers from the Parish who lost their lives was read out.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>news</category><guid>http://dodcott.org/posts/2014-08-04-world-war-one-remembrance-ceremony./</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2014 13:49:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>2014-05-12 Annual Parish Meeting and AGM.</title><link>http://dodcott.org/posts/2014-05-12-annual-parish-meeting-and-agm./</link><dc:creator>Dodcott-cum-Wilkesley Parish Council</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The Annual Parish Meeting will be held on Monday 12th May 2014 at 7:00pm at Burleydam Village Hall.
