<p>I have moved the web site so that it is now hosted on Github.com. I have also
changed the site generator from <a href="https://pelican.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/">Pelican</a> to <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>.</p>
<p>I'll put up another post later to explain why I have made these
changes. Meanwhile you may notice a few minor glitches in this site, while I iron out
all the little bugs caused by the changes.</p>
<p>The new site should well on both mobile devices and computers.</p>
